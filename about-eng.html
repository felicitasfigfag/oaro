                    NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are blockchain-based tokens that can be used to represent digital ownership of something unique and scarce such as artwork, collectibles, soundtracks or virtual real estate. <br>  <br> 
                    Because NFTs are stored on a blockchain, it means each token has the following characteristics: <strong><i>indivisible, indestructible, immutable</i></strong>  (impossible to change the underlying information once it's stored) <strong><i>verifiable</i></strong>  (because NFTs are stored on public blockchains, authenticity and ownership can be easily verified by anyone at any time) <br> <br>
                    In the art sector, an NFT is a piece of digital art (image, video, GIF, music, etc.) with a certificate of authenticity that is unique, indivisible and transferable. The technology is used to create a verifiable digital scarcity, as well as provide digital ownership. That is, a public certificate of exclusivity on a digital work that cannot be altered. <br> <br>
                    This means that when you buy the NFT artwork you will have a blockchain certificate (instant validation anywhere in the world) that will give you the ability to prove that you are the only owner of this NFT now and in the future. Then, you can decide if you want to keep it, auction it or sell it (at the price you want).

                    This new NFT art marketplace is different for several reasons
 <br>
                    <br> 1- <strong>Durán Digital</strong> makes a difference by incorporating selected and certified artwork by Durán. Arte y Subastas into its offer and using OARO's blockchain technology - unlike other NFTs platforms in which anyone can create their digital assets, mixing works by renowned artists along with others with no greater symbolic value in the same place.

                    <br> 2- This marketplace operates with Eco-NFTs on OARO's private cloud blockchain platform, a more environmentally friendly alternative to NFTs created on the public Ethereum blockchain. A study carried out by the Polytechnic University of Madrid, certifies that the OARO network is 99.99% more efficient in terms of energy than the public network, with a CO2 emission of approximately 0,2 grams (the weight of a feather, as a comparison).

                    <br> 3- At <strong> Durán Digital</strong>each artist has control (traceability) of all their works and the path of each one (changes of ownership), which provides security for both users and collectors, as well as for the artists who sell their works here.
